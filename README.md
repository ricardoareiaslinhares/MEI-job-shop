## Our aproach to the problem
We began by exploring the most straighforward solutions, we developed a greedy approach ``sequencial_greedy.c``. However, we realized that this approach wouldnâ€™t benefit from parallelism due to its linear nature.

We developed our final approach utilizing the Branch and Bound algorithm, which explores all possible solutions and finds the most optimal ``sequencial_bb.c``. Using this as base we developed a paralled aproach ``paralelo.c``

## Compile and run the programs

**Sequencial**
```bash
# On Mac
gcc-14 sequencial.c utils.c -o sequencial

# Usage: ./sequencial inputFile outputFile
./sequencial gg03.jss output.txt
```

**Paralelo**
```bash
# On Mac
gcc-14 paralelo.c utils.c -o paralelo

# Usage: ./paralelo inputFile outputFile numberOfThreads
./sequencial gg03.jss output.txt 3
```
